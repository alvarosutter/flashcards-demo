# Flashcards App

App to create decks of flashcards.

## Description

This project was made with the intention of learning and practicing React and TypeScript.

It is an app that lets the user create decks of flashcards and organize them using labels. The cards are simple and
consist only of name and content. Additionally, you may add one or more labels. You can then browse all the cards in a
deck or all cards with a particular label.

The frontend for Flashcards App offers user interface to create, read, update and delete Decks, Cards, and Labels. The
frontend was build using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),
[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**Important**: This version does not connect to any database, your data will be saved in the browser Local Storage. This
version also allows duplicates names do to the lack of validation and may have issues not present in the full version.
You can see a demo version of the app on [myflashcardsapp.netlify.app](https://myflashcardsapp.netlify.app/).

You can find the version with database and backend using docker here:
